# Road to Web 3 Week 3 Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case, which is to Make NFTs with on-chain metadata, using Hardhat and JavaScript. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

TThe contract is live on the polygon mumbai testnet here: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x188b0e2FDBA9e84228d668B18162B075d67c94ef
